# Building a new Implementation of Muon

Muon is designed to be polyglot and has a strong concept of compatibility.

This comes from the nature of Muon libraries, which maps the rich communication concepts down to particular network protocols that form the transports.

There are Muon libraries implemented in multiple languages, however not all languages! If you want to integrate with the Muon ecosystem (for example, Photon) in a natural way, and gain the greatest benefit then the most effective way is to use a Muon library.

This document describes the process to go through in order to build a new implementation of Muon.

## Introducing the Protocol Specifications

The point of compatibility in Muon are the transport network protocols. Your new implementation is 

## Design and build a language idiomatic API

A full implementation of Muon allows
