# Building a new Implementation of Muon

Muon is designed to be polyglot and has a strong concept of compatibility.

This comes from the nature of Muon libraries, which maps the rich communication concepts down to particular network protocols that form the transports.

There are Muon libraries implemented in multiple languages, but not all of them. If you want to integrate with the Muon ecosystem (for example, Photon) in a natural way, and gain the greatest benefit then the most effective way is to use a Muon library.

This document describes the process to go through in order to build a new implementation of Muon.
